# LOGGY

This Python 3 module is an attempt to create a set of tools to add dynamic items
that can be updated in a streaming terminal similar to xterm. It mostly relies
on VT100 escape sequences but there are also some specific to xterm and rxvt
that I've found necessary to include. The goal is not to make something that
works everywhere, it's just meant to work for me. Any patches that makes it
handle other terminals or OSs is appreciated.
